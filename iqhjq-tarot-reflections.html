What I am not sure about is why, and some days I believe different theories are more likely. Here are among my two favorite very different ones. What do you think of why tarot cards work? Theory 1 (scientific mind): there is no meaning in the cards themselves. The meaning is all inside the interpreter’s head. It really does not matter which cards one chooses but any card can serve as a starting point to discovering insight that is already there Do we act differently if we are being watched? What if the one who is watching is us? If we could stand outside ourselves and look at our lives, would we respond to life in a different.
